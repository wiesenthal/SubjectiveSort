# SubjectiveSort

Sort lists subjectively by giving the user several binary choices.

## Implementation

I implemented Ford-Johnson merge-insertion sort algorithm in javascript to minimize number of comparisons. Uses the user input as the compare function. I chose this algorithm because it is the designed to minimize comparisons, therefore minimizing user-input, by far the most time consuming operation for this application.

## Usage

Start, can upload a csv or paste/type in manually. tab, comma, or newline separated values will be parsed correctly.

It will show you 2 items at a team, you click the one which is higher than the other on whatever subjective scale you determine. I recommend picking based on your intuitive gut-reaction for speed and mental neutrality.

The results screen has option to sort ascending or descending.

If you already have a sorted list and want to add to it, use https://wiesenthal.github.io/SubjectiveSort/partial/partial.html.
