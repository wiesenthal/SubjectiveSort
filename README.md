# SubjectiveSort
Sort lists subjectively by giving the user comparisons 2 items at a time.

Implemented Ford-Johnson merge-insertion sort algorithm in javascript to minimize number of comparisons. Uses the user input as the compare function. This algorithm I chose because comparisons are practically the only significant efficiency cost.

Start, can upload a csv or paste/type in manually. tab, comma, or newline separated values will be parsed correctly.
